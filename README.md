# Language-Recognition
This project focuses on language recognition, with a particular emphasis on low-resource languages. It leverages a combination of high-resource datasets (e.g., WiLI-2018) and low-resource datasets (Bible texts from ScriptureEarth) to develop and evaluate models for text classification.
